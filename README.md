Rust Console Game Engine
========================
This is a **hobby** project. It's a console game engine for Rust. Heavily inspired by [javidx9's One Lone Coder Console Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/olcConsoleGameEngine.h). The goal is to learn Rust and a bit about making games.

For now, it only works on Windows.

Usage
-----
`cargo build` the First Person Shooter example from **examples/fps/**. The actual engine is in **src/lib.rs**.
